# OverlayNetwrokOptimization
 Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the cost of an overlay network of 25 nodes. A GA is constructed from several distinct constituents to start the cost optimization problem.
 These constituents include chromosome encoding, fitness function, selection, recombination & the evolution scheme. In this problem, every individual in a population encodes a  complete network and each link is either active or inactive.  The GA has applied to find the average & best chromosome in the population and create a performance graph to see  the convergence
